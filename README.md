This is a simple web crawler that scrapes listing details from Craigslist (an American ecommerce site). The script gets a list of keywords to be searched on Craigslist from the Search Keywords.txt file. After searching through a given number of result pages for each search keyword the crawler visits all the listing URLs it found. Next the crawler extracts data from the listing pages (such as item ID and title). There are two database tables, one which contains a list of listing URLs to visit and another which contains the scraped details for each listing.
